# Zilliqa nodes and validator documentation
This section serves as a comprehensive guide to Zilliqa nodes and explains the process of becoming a validator in the Zilliqa Proof of Stake network.

The documentation provides a step-by-step guide to setting up a node in the ZQ2 network and joining as a validator node in both the Zilliqa prototestnet and protomainnet networks. While prototestnet is used as the reference network throughout this guide, the instructions are equally applicable to the protomainnet network.

For more details, please refer to the [Networks section](../endpoints.md#networks).
