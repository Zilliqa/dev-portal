# Zilliqa nodes and validator documentation
This section serves as a comprehensive guide to Zilliqa nodes and explains the process of becoming a validator in the Zilliqa Proof of Stake network.

The documentation provides a step-by-step guide to setting up a node in a ZQ2 network and adding it as a validator. While mainnet is used as the reference network throughout this guide, the node setup instructions are equally applicable to the testnet and devnet.

For more details, please refer to the [Networks section](../endpoints.md#networks).
