# The Zilliqa 2.0 Developer Portal
<div class="flex" markdown>
<div markdown>
Welcome to the developer documentation for Zilliqa 2.0, a fast-finality, scalable blockchain protocol. Zilliqa 2.0 features a native EVM execution layer, supporting standard EVM development tools and wallets while also retaining a custom execution layer based on the [Scilla](https://scilla.readthdocs.io/latest) smart contract language.

## The Whitepaper
Zilliqa 2.0 is based on 2 years of research into cutting-edge blockchain technology. To learn more about the design of the Zilliqa 2.0 protocol, [read the whitepaper](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XqSySl0w_OtxyxBZ0ahS06cqIv-vd10M/view).

## Core protocol
At the current stage of Zilliqa 2.0 development, the core protocol is available to test via the Jasper proto-testnet. To achieve the best possible performance, we decided to re-implement our entire protocol in Rust.

## Proto-testnet
The proto-testnet exists as the first implementation of the Zilliqa 2.0 consensus mechanism, which comprises Proof-of-Stake validator selection paired with Pipelined Fast-HotStuff for fast and efficient transaction processing.
