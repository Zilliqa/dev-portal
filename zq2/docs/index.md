# Zilliqa 2.0 Developer Documentation

Welcome to the developer documentation for Zilliqa 2.0, a fast-finality, scalable blockchain protocol. Zilliqa 2.0 features a native EVM execution layer, supporting standard EVM development tools and wallets while also retaining a custom execution layer based on the [Scilla](https://scilla.readthdocs.io/latest) smart contract language. 

__For an overview__ of the features and capabilities introduced in Zilliqa 2.0, please visit the [roadmap website](https://roadmap.zilliqa.com/), where you can also find a list of development milestones. 

__To learn more__ about the design of the Zilliqa 2.0 protocol, [read the whitepaper](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XqSySl0w_OtxyxBZ0ahS06cqIv-vd10M/view).

__At the current stage__ of Zilliqa 2.0 development, the core protocol is available to test via the Jasper proto-testnet. 

__The proto-testnet__ exists as the first implementation of the Zilliqa 2.0 consensus mechanism, which comprises Proof-of-Stake validator selection paired with Pipelined Fast-HotStuff for fast and efficient transaction processing.

Here you will find documentation related to the current implementation of Zilliqa 2.0, including:
