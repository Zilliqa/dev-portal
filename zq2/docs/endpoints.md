# Endpoints, Block Explorer and Faucet

As we introduce additional test networks for Zilliqa 2.0, their public RPC node URLs and chain IDs will be published on [ChainList](https://chainlist.org/?search=zilliqa&testnets=true) alongside existing chain information for Zilliqa 1.0.

## Networks

Details for the current network versions of Zilliqa 2.0 are listed below.

<div class="table" markdown>
|  Name  | Version | ChainId | API | Otterscan | Faucet  |
| ------ | ------- | ------- | --- | --------- | ------  |
| proto-testnet | v0.1.0 | 33103 | https://api.zq2-prototestnet.zilliqa.com	 | https://explorer.zq2-prototestnet.zilliqa.com | https://faucet.zq2-prototestnet.zilliqa.com |
</div>

_**Note** that this is currently a proto-testnet version of Zilliqa 2.0 designed primarily for testing purposes, and therefore its state and uptime are not guaranteed_

## Block Explorer

The current version of Zilliqa 2.0 is compatible with the Otterscan block explorer and does not support Devex.

The block explorer for the Zilliqa 2.0 proto-testnet is [available here](https://explorer.zq2-prototestnet.zilliqa.com/).

## Faucet

The faucet sends an amount of 100 ZIL to the supplied address for use in testing the network.

Enter the hex address of your compatible EVM wallet into the field below to receive 100 ZIL on the Zilliqa 2.0 proto-testnet:
