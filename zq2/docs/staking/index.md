# Staking Mechanism

The staking mechanism supports two variants:

## Staking Variants

### 1. **Liquid Staking**

- Users receive a **non-rebasing Liquid Staking Token (LST)** upon delegation.
- The LST can be sent to the validator's contract to withdraw the staked amount along with the corresponding share of validator rewards.

### 2. **Non-Liquid Staking**

- Users can withdraw their share of the rewards regularly without unstaking their principal amount.
