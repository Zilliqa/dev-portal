# The Graph

The Graph is a decentralized indexing protocol that makes it easy to query blockchain data using APIs called subgraphs.

When building a dApp, accessing historical smart contract data can be challenging. The Graph solves this by allowing developers to create and use subgraphsâ€”open APIs that organize and serve blockchain data efficiently. Its decentralized network of indexers ensures your dApp remains trustless and resilient.

## Why use The Graph?

The Graph offers a powerful, decentralized solution for indexing and querying blockchain data. It removes the need for centralized servers, reducing bottlenecks and single points of failure. With its network of indexers, The Graph delivers fast, reliable access to on-chain data. You can use GraphQL queries to fetch exactly the information your dApp needs.

## Key Features

- **Decentralized Indexing:** Multiple independent indexers process and serve data, ensuring high availability and no single point of failure.
- **GraphQL Queries:** Query indexed blockchain data easily and flexibly using the GraphQL language.
- **Customizable & Reusable:** Define your own subgraphs to transform and store blockchain data, or use subgraphs published by others to accelerate development.
