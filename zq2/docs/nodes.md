### Becoming a Validator
Under the consensus mechanism introduced in Zilliqa 2.0, validators stake ZIL to secure the network, in return for which they receive a share of block rewards.

While becoming a validator on the Zilliqa 2.0 mainnet will be permissionless, on the current proto-testnet you need to request the minimum required stake of 10 million ZIL in order for you to register as a validator.

To register as a validator on the Jasper proto-testnet, please complete and submit this form.
